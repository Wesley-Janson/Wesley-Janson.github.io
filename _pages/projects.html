Here is a sample of projects I have done at the University of Chicago. Please stay tuned as I update this page!

My work with the University of Chicago's Center for Municipal Finance involved creating their "Data Dashboard", which provides users with a range of data visualizations concerning municipal bond trading, pricing, and liquidity measures.
This required me to use SQL and R to ... Using the Highcharter package in R, I am able to create these HTML charts, which have been featured in multiple media outlets.

This final paper for STAT 27420: Causal Inference with Machine Learning (written with Drew Keller) was completed in the Fall 2022 quarter. We revisited "Inflation Expectations and Readiness to Spend: Cross-Sectional Evidence", written by RÃ¼diger Bachmann, Tim O. Berg and Eric R. Sims.
They explore the relationship between 1-year expected inflation and consumer spending attitudes-more specifically, durable goods purchasing. We proposed an alternative, non-parametric methodology implementing the augmented inverse probability of treatment weighting 
(AIPTW) estimator with gradient-boosted random forests. We found similar results to Bachmann et al: a generally small but significant average negative effect of consumer inflation expectations on attitudes towards spending on durable goods.

As a capstone project for the second quarter of the core computer programming in Python sequence, my group created a user interface using the University of Chicago's Virtual Desktop.
This project enabled the exploration of various demographic, economic, and political features on federal government aid to counties after natural disasters in the U.S. We collected data 
from several government sources, including the Census Bureau and FEMA, to capture demographic, economic, and natural disaster measures. Our project included a Plotly Dash interface where 
users could interact with the data to explore the relationship between various demographic variables and FEMA aid provided to counties affected by natural disasters.
