**Portfolio Theory and Municipal Revenue: Service Structures and Risk Asymmetry** (In Progress, with <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/justinjmarlowe/" data-sf-ec-immutable="" data-sf-marked="" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Justin Marlowe</span></a>, <a href="https://carleton.ca/sppa/people/grasse-nathan/" data-sf-ec-immutable="" data-sf-marked="" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nathan Grasse</span></a>, and <a href="https://profiles.utdallas.edu/elizabeth.searing" data-sf-ec-immutable="" data-sf-marked="" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Elizabeth Searing</span></a>) <br>

**Summary:** Municipal governments rely on revenue management to fund service provisions, and conventional wisdom suggests that diversification is beneficial. Although the Hirschman-Herfindahl Index (HHI) is commonly used to measure municipal revenue diversification (concentration), it overlooks key characteristics such as growth, risk, and covariance that underpin the rationale for diversification based on modern portfolio theory (MPT) (Markowitz, 1952; Janson and Marlowe, 2023). Scholars have applied MPT to government and municipal revenue portfolios (White, 1979; White and Chou, 1980; Berg, Marlin, and Heydarpour, 2000; Harmon and Mallick, 1994); this paper extends that work using financial data from Minnesota municipalities (2003–2022). We identify optimal portfolios through mean-variance and mean semivariance analysis, offering insights into the importance of risk measurement—particularly risk asymmetry—and how municipal service profiles can shape efficient revenue structures. This demonstrates the importance of the definition of risk, which impacts the composition of portfolios, the level of possible return, and the diversification identified as theoretically ideal. Our results have wide-ranging implications from local government administration to evaluation in municipal bond markets.

**Abstract:** Accurate rent measurement is essential for contructing a consumer price index (CPI) and for measuring household welfare. Late payment fees and nonpayment in rent are common components of rental expenditures and thus belong in CPIs. Late payment fees are often excluded; we offer a novel critique. In the US CPI, nonpayment is ostensibly included, but, we show, severely undermeasured. Moreover, the manner of its inclusion renders the CPI extremely sensitive to nonpayment variations; we show how to fix this. Nonpayment under-measurement suggests at least a +1 ppt overestimate in 2020 CPI shelter inflation. Timely nonpayment and late fee measurement is challenging; we offer a practical solution.

**Improving Inference via Data-Based Identification of Unobserved Variables and Unusual Data Points** (In Progress, with <a href="https://www.clevelandfed.org/research/economists/verbrugge-randal-j" data-sf-ec-immutable="" data-sf-marked="" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Randal J. Verbrugge</span></a>) <br>
<span style="color:dark gray;font-weight:400;font-size:16.5px">
**Abstract:** Omitted variable bias is well-known problem that, if the variable is not present in a data set, seems impossible to discover. But two other problems are equally damaging and underappreciated: most classical estimators are highly fragile (their asymptotic distributions diverge with modest contamination) and have low breakdown points (the estimate can be totally spoiled by a miniscule percentage of unusual data). None of these threats disappear asymptotically; none is easy to detect in large, multivariate data; all of them compromise inference. Herein we show how, in some cases, one may use the data at hand (only) to detect the presence of an omitted variable: by locating sets of points that appear to come from a different data-generating mechanism. Their detection can lead to deep insights into the data-generating mechanism. We provide some salient examples.
