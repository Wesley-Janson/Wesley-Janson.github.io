**Portfolio Theory and Municipal Revenue: Service Structures and Risk Asymmetry** (In Progress, with <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/justinjmarlowe/" data-sf-ec-immutable="" data-sf-marked="" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Justin Marlowe</span></a>, <a href="https://carleton.ca/sppa/people/grasse-nathan/" data-sf-ec-immutable="" data-sf-marked="" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nathan Grasse</span></a>, and <a href="https://profiles.utdallas.edu/elizabeth.searing" data-sf-ec-immutable="" data-sf-marked="" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Elizabeth Searing</span></a>) <br>

**Summary:** Municipal governments provide services, and revenue management provides funds for these activities. The conventional wisdom regarding revenue management holds that diversification is beneficial. This notion is based on modern portfolio theory (MPT), originally developed to identify the optimal mix of investment assets based on estimates of their likely return, risk, and covariance (Markowitz 1952). However, the most commonly utilized measure of municipal revenue structures is the Hirschman-Herfindahl Index (HHI), which captures only the revenue portfolio’s diversity (or concentration). This means that HHI alone will likely be poorly suited to understanding revenue structure performance, as it provides no information derived from the essential characteristics of the revenue streams incorporated into the revenue structure—their growth, risk, and covariance— that, conceptually, underly the logic for diversification (Janson & Marlowe, 2023). <br>
Scholars have used MPT to analyze government revenue portfolios (White 1979, 1980), including municipal portfolios (Berg & Heydarpout 2000, Mallick & Harmon 1994, White 1980). This paper applies MPT to the revenue structures of Minnesota’s municipal government using a panel of financial data from 2003 to 2022, identifying theoretically optimal portfolios with both mean-variance and mean semi-variance techniques. It will inform municipal revenue management in two ways: 1) assessing the importance of risk measurement in portfolio analysis, introducing risk asymmetry to distinguish between upside and downside deviations, and 2) providing information on the importance of service provision to revenue management by identifying how municipal service profiles might condition the specification of portfolio efficiency.

**Abstract:** Accurate rent measurement is essential for contructing a consumer price index (CPI) and for measuring household welfare. Late payment fees and nonpayment in rent are common components of rental expenditures and thus belong in CPIs. Late payment fees are often excluded; we offer a novel critique. In the US CPI, nonpayment is ostensibly included, but, we show, severely undermeasured. Moreover, the manner of its inclusion renders the CPI extremely sensitive to nonpayment variations; we show how to fix this. Nonpayment under-measurement suggests at least a +1 ppt overestimate in 2020 CPI shelter inflation. Timely nonpayment and late fee measurement is challenging; we offer a practical solution.

**Improving Inference via Data-Based Identification of Unobserved Variables and Unusual Data Points** (In Progress, with <a href="https://www.clevelandfed.org/research/economists/verbrugge-randal-j" data-sf-ec-immutable="" data-sf-marked="" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Randal J. Verbrugge</span></a>) <br>
<span style="color:dark gray;font-weight:400;font-size:16.5px">
**Abstract:** Omitted variable bias is well-known problem that, if the variable is not present in a data set, seems impossible to discover. But two other problems are equally damaging and underappreciated: most classical estimators are highly fragile (their asymptotic distributions diverge with modest contamination) and have low breakdown points (the estimate can be totally spoiled by a miniscule percentage of unusual data). None of these threats disappear asymptotically; none is easy to detect in large, multivariate data; all of them compromise inference. Herein we show how, in some cases, one may use the data at hand (only) to detect the presence of an omitted variable: by locating sets of points that appear to come from a different data-generating mechanism. Their detection can lead to deep insights into the data-generating mechanism. We provide some salient examples.
