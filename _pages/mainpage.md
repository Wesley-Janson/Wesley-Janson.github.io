My name is Wesley Janson and I am currently a second-year student in the M.S. in Computational Analysis and Public Policy program at the University of Chicago. My interests lie within the intersection of economic policy and data science. I aim to have a career in the intersection of the two, using computational statistics to implement sound public policy.

Previously, I was a Research Analyst at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, where I supported two bank economists with their research, and assist in the  preparation of materials ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings. Most of my research was on the topics of macroeconomics, monetary policy, and inflation expectations/dynamics.

Please stay tuned as I update this website!
