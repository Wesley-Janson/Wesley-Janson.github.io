My name is Wesley Janson and I am currently a second-year student in the M.S. in Computational Analysis and Public Policy program at the University of Chicago. My interests lie within the intersection of economic policy and data science. I aim to have a career using machine learning and computational statistics to help implement sound economic policy.

Currently, at the University of Chicago I have taken coursework in machine learning, databases, programming in Python, and statistics. I work as a Research Assistant for Securities Quote Xchange, a financial services firm specializing in alternative trading systems for fixed income securities, implementing machine learning/econometric modeling to enhance products for clients. I also work at the Center for Municipal Finance at the Harris School of Public Policy, where I maintain the Center's <a href="https://munifinance.uchicago.edu/data_dashboard/" data-sf-ec-immutable="" data-sf-marked="" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Data Dashboard</span></a>
, which provides users with a range of data visualizations concerning municipal bond trading, pricing, and liquidity measures.

Previously, I was a Research Analyst at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, where I supported two bank economists with their research, and assisted in the  preparation of materials ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings. Most of my research was on the topics of macroeconomics, monetary policy, and inflation expectations/dynamics. With [Randy Verbrugge](https://www.clevelandfed.org/research/economists/verbrugge-randal-j) and [Carola Binder](https://carolabinder.sites.haverford.edu/), I coauthored [Out of Bounds: Do SPF Respondents Have Anchored Inflation Expectations?](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jmcb.12968), which is forthcoming in the Journal of Money, Credit & Banking.
