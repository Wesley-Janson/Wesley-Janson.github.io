My name is Wesley Janson and I am an incoming Data Scientist with the Internal Revenue Service's Research, Analytics, and Applied Statistics division. Finishing my graduate studies in June 2023 with an M.S. in Computational Analysis and Public Policy program at the University of Chicago, my interests lie within the intersection of economic policy and data science. I aim to have a career using machine learning and computational statistics to help implement sound economic policy.

At the University of Chicago I took coursework in machine learning, databases, programming in Python, large-scale computing, and causal inference. I work as a Data Science Assistant for Securities Quote Xchange, a financial services firm specializing in alternative trading systems for fixed income securities, implementing machine learning and econometric modeling to enhance products for clients. I also work at the Center for Municipal Finance at the Harris School of Public Policy, where I maintain the Center's <a href="https://munifinance.uchicago.edu/data_dashboard/" data-sf-ec-immutable="" data-sf-marked="" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Data Dashboard</span></a>, which provides users with a range of data visualizations concerning municipal bond trading, pricing, and liquidity measures.

Previously, I was a Research Analyst at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, where I supported two bank economists with their research, and assisted in the  preparation of materials ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings. Most of my research was on the topics of macroeconomics, monetary policy, and inflation expectations/dynamics. With <a href="https://www.clevelandfed.org/research/economists/verbrugge-randal-j" data-sf-ec-immutable="" data-sf-marked="" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Randy Verbrugge</span></a> and <a href="https://carolabinder.sites.haverford.edu/" data-sf-ec-immutable="" data-sf-marked="" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Carola Binder</span></a>, I coauthored <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jmcb.12968" data-sf-ec-immutable="" data-sf-marked="" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Out of Bounds: Do SPF Respondents Have Anchored Inflation Expectations?</span></a>, featured in the April 2023 edition of the *Journal of Money, Credit & Banking*. 

Outside of work and the classroom, I enjoy staying active. I spend my time rock climbing, golfing, going to the gym, and running along Lake Michigan. I also like to check out all of the live music and great food Chicago has to offer!
